Recreating iOS “Liquid Glass” Effect in Flutter: Technical Breakdown and Requirements

Overview: Apple’s Liquid Glass Design

Apple’s Liquid Glass is a dynamic UI material (introduced around iOS 16 and later formalized in iOS 26) that “combines the optical properties of glass with a sense of fluidity” . In practice, Liquid Glass panels are translucent UI elements that blur and refract whatever is behind them, creating a realistic glass-like appearance. Unlike static frosted glass effects of the past, Liquid Glass is highly interactive and adaptive – it reflects the colors/light of its surroundings, responds to user motion, and maintains readability in varying contexts  . Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines emphasize using this effect to enhance visual hierarchy without obscuring content, unifying the design across devices  . Below, we break down the key components of the Liquid Glass effect and the technical requirements to reproduce them in Flutter.

Key Components and Technical Requirements

1. Background Blur and Light Diffusion

At its core, the Liquid Glass look is achieved through a strong background blur applied to whatever is behind the glass panel. This creates a frosted-glass translucency, so underlying content is visible but defocused. Apple’s implementation uses a Gaussian blur (as pioneered in iOS 7’s frosted UI) applied in real time . In addition, Liquid Glass diffuses light and color from the backdrop into the glass: bright areas bloom softly and the panel takes on a subtle tint from the background . In Apple’s terms, “Liquid Glass blurs content behind it [and] reflects the color and light of surrounding content.”  This implies two technical requirements:
	•	Blur Filter – A real-time Gaussian blur effect on the backdrop. On iOS this is done via Core Image or UIBlurEffect (e.g. an .ultraThinMaterial in SwiftUI). In Flutter, this requires an ImageFilter blur (e.g. using BackdropFilter) to continually blur the underlying content. The blur radius should be tuned to emulate Apple’s materials (often a medium blur for a “frosted” look). The effect may be downsampled for performance (blurring a low-res snapshot then scaling up) since Gaussian blur is expensive.
	•	Vibrancy/Light Diffusion – The blurred content’s bright colors and highlights should bleed through to give the panel a glow. Apple achieves this with “vibrancy” effects that add brightness and saturation from the background into the glass . Technically, this can mean applying a bloom filter or simply layering a semi-transparent white to brighten light areas. In Flutter, one could overlay a color blended widget or adjust the blurred image’s color matrix to ensure bright spots aren’t dulled. The goal is that if there’s a light source or vivid color behind the glass, the blur will diffuse it, creating that illuminated glass feel (similar to how a flashlight behind frosted glass creates a glow).

2. Dynamic Interaction with Background (Motion Response)

A hallmark of Liquid Glass is that it’s highly dynamic – the glass effect reacts in real time to movement and user interactions . In Apple’s UI, the distortion and blur are continuously updated as the user or content moves. For example, if a user drags a “glass” panel or scrolls content behind it, the warped background and highlights on the glass update every frame to reflect the new backdrop. Apple explicitly notes that Liquid Glass “reacts to touch and pointer interactions in real time.” 

Technical requirements: The effect must be recalculated and redrawn continuously when either the glass widget moves or the background changes. This demands an animation loop or GPU-driven shader rather than a static cached blur. Apple’s Core Animation and Metal frameworks are used to animate these effects efficiently on the GPU. As a rule, GPU acceleration is essential – doing a fresh blur + distortion on the CPU for 60 FPS is infeasible. As one analysis explains, if you tried to grab and re-blur the background for every frame via CPU, it would be “brutally expensive and would crush frame rate almost instantly.”  Instead, Apple leverages fragment shaders so the GPU can compute the effect per-pixel in parallel each frame .

In Flutter, this means the Liquid Glass widget should utilize the engine’s compositor or shaders for real-time updates. For example, one can use an AnimatedBuilder or Ticker to refresh the effect and a Fragment shader (GLSL via FragmentProgram) to handle per-pixel distortion (discussed below) on the GPU. The effect should also respond to user gestures (e.g. drag or scroll events) by adjusting the shader parameters (such as the position of a distortion center) immediately. Additionally, Apple’s design even reacts to device motion – tilting the device causes subtle changes in the glass’s reflection/refraction, giving a parallax effect . Reproducing this would entail using device sensors (gyroscope/accelerometer) in Flutter to slightly shift the rendering (for example, altering a light highlight position or the distortion offset based on tilt).

3. Dynamic Tone Mapping Based on Background

Liquid Glass intelligently adapts its appearance based on the background’s color and brightness to maintain clarity. Apple’s HIG notes that the material can switch between lighter or darker tints to ensure text and icons on the glass remain legible . In practice, if the backdrop behind the glass is very bright, the glass might adopt a slightly darker translucent tint (and use dark text), whereas over a dark background the glass might be very clear or lightly tinted (with light text). This adaptive tone mapping is essentially an automatic contrast adjustment.

Technical requirements: The system needs to analyze the backdrop (at least its average luminosity or color palette) in real time. On iOS, this is handled by the system’s UIBlurEffect APIs (which have “regular” or “prominent” materials that internally adapt) or by the Vibrancy effect for text. The Apple documentation states that Liquid Glass “adapts to a light or dark appearance to make text and icons on top of the material legible.”  In a Flutter implementation, one might achieve this by sampling the background image underneath the glass (perhaps downsampled to a small region or using the blurred result) to determine if it’s mostly dark or light. Based on that, the glass widget can adjust its tint: e.g. applying a semi-transparent dark overlay for very bright backgrounds, or a lighter/translucent overlay for dark backgrounds, to ensure adequate contrast. Additionally, text or icon color on the glass should switch between light and dark mode depending on background – similar to iOS’s UIVibrancyEffect which ensures, say, label text is visible over a blurred backdrop. This dynamic tone mapping ensures the glass element always maintains readability and visual balance regardless of the underlying wallpaper or content.

(Example: On iOS 16’s lock screen, the clock can appear in a “Glass” style – if the wallpaper is bright, the clock’s glass outline is rendered in a darker translucent tone so the white clock digits remain readable, whereas on a dark wallpaper the glass might be a lighter translucency  .)

4. Depth, Refraction, and 3D “Glassiness”

A key aspect that makes Liquid Glass feel realistic (and not just a flat blur) is the sense of depth and dimensionality. Apple achieves this through refraction (distortion) and specular highlights (reflections) that mimic real glass. According to Apple, the Liquid Glass material “refracts and reflects any element placed behind it, using realistic lighting and shaders to look like a real piece of glass.”  In design terms, this is often called a lensing effect – the glass bends light passing through it. For example, objects seen through the glass might appear slightly shifted or magnified, especially near the edges of the glass where a curved surface would refract more. Apple’s designers even added subtle outer highlights along the shape’s edges , suggesting a light source reflecting off the glass surface. These details give a 3D illusion that the UI element has thickness and is made of physical glass.

Technical requirements: To replicate this, we need to implement a distortion shader and possibly a lighting model:
	•	Refraction/Distortion: The background texture needs to be sampled with an offset to simulate light bending. Technically, one can use a displacement map or mathematical function based on the glass shape. For example, a convex glass (like a rounded rectangle “lens”) might slightly magnify the center and pull in the background from the edges. In Apple’s Metal shader or Core Image pipeline, this could be done with a custom kernel that perturbs texture coordinates. In Flutter, this would likely be a fragment shader that reads the backdrop (as a texture) and computes an offset for each pixel inside the glass shape. The offset can be derived from the shape’s distance field or a normal map. The Medium article analyzing Liquid Glass confirms that the “background warps and flows” depending on the panel’s shape, and uses a fragment shader to compute distortion per pixel  . We would need to feed the shader parameters like the glass panel’s size/position to calculate this refraction. The result is that straight lines seen through the glass appear bent and objects slightly shifted – conveying that light is passing through a curved glass. This refraction should update continuously (as discussed) if either the glass or background moves.
	•	Specular Highlights (Lighting): Real glass catches highlights from ambient light. Apple’s implementation includes realistic lighting on the glass  – for example, a shiny ridge along the edges or where light would reflect. To simulate this, one can overlay a subtle gradient or glow on the glass element. Apple reportedly even ties this to device orientation (so the highlight moves as you tilt the device, creating a parallax shine) . In Flutter, a simple method is to draw a faint white highlight along the top/edges of the shape (perhaps via an inner shadow or border with reduced opacity). A more advanced approach is to compute a specular term in the fragment shader: treat the glass as having a normal vector and a light source – for instance, a light coming from the top-left could produce a highlight on the corresponding side of the glass. The shader could use a faux normal for the 2D shape (e.g. a beveled effect) and add a blurring additive highlight. If device motion is available, the “light direction” can be adjusted slightly to always come from, say, the true upward direction of gravity, giving the impression of a consistent world light source.
	•	Shadows/Depth: Adding a shadow or depth blur can also help convey that the glass panel is a layer above the background. Apple’s glass components often have soft shadows or a separated layer appearance (for instance, floating panels in iPadOS). In Flutter, we should allow an elevation or shadow for the glass widget (e.g. a subtle drop shadow) to reinforce layering. Additionally, Apple’s design avoids stacking multiple glass layers on top of each other (which can confuse depth perception); the HIG suggests never putting “glass on glass” directly . Thus, a Flutter implementation should be used for primary surfaces, not layered excessively.

5. Performance Requirements for Real-Time Mobile Rendering

Rendering a blur + refraction effect in real time over dynamic content is computationally intensive, especially on mobile. Apple explicitly leveraged Apple Silicon GPU performance to make Liquid Glass possible across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, etc., noting that their custom chips provide “extra computational power” for these heavy shaders . The technical goal is to achieve 60 FPS (or higher on ProMotion displays) without significant battery drain. Key requirements include:
	•	GPU Acceleration & Shaders: As mentioned, the entire pipeline should run on the GPU. Core Animation layers with UIVisualEffectView likely use Metal under the hood. In Flutter, this means using Skia’s GPU backend or writing a custom shader via FragmentProgram. All pixel-by-pixel operations (blur convolution, sampling for distortion) must be offloaded to fragment shaders or GPU filters. Avoid CPU image processing in the frame loop. The difference is night and day: “CPU-based bitmap manipulation is too slow for real-time interaction, but GPU shaders are instant and efficient.” 
	•	Optimized Blur: Even on GPU, Gaussian blur can be expensive over large areas. Typical optimizations include scaling down the source before blurring (reducing pixel count) and possibly using a multi-pass blur (separable convolution) or even approximate blur shaders for speed. The Flutter backdrop filter inherently uses such optimizations (Skia’s blur shader). Ensuring the blur shader uses a reasonably small kernel (e.g. 5x5 or 9x9) is important for performance  . We may allow configuring blur intensity to balance look vs performance.
	•	Batching and Caching: If multiple Liquid Glass widgets are on screen, we should avoid recomputing separate blurs for each if they overlap. Apple provides a GlassEffectContainer in SwiftUI that groups glass views for “best rendering performance”  – essentially merging their rendering to avoid redundant draws. In Flutter, we might ensure that if two glass widgets are adjacent or overlapping, we only blur the background once (perhaps by having one canvas layer for all glass, or by not stacking translucent layers atop each other). Minimizing overdraw (multiple translucent passes) is key for mobile GPU efficiency.
	•	Memory and Battery: Real-time shaders will use memory for render targets (especially if downsampling, an offscreen texture is needed). We must manage the texture sizes (e.g. not blurring the whole screen at full res unnecessarily) to keep memory and GPU bandwidth reasonable. Additionally, consider offering a quality toggle or respecting “Reduce Transparency” accessibility setting. Apple notes that users can turn on Reduce Transparency to “minimize the Liquid Glass effects” for better performance or legibility  . Our Flutter solution should ideally detect or allow a mode to disable the heavy blur/refraction and fall back to a simpler UI if needed (for users who prioritize performance/accessibility).

By meeting these technical requirements – efficient blurring, real-time GPU updates, adaptive coloring, realistic distortion, and careful performance tuning – we can recreate Apple’s Liquid Glass effect in Flutter.

Design Intent and Usage in Apple’s UI

Apple introduced Liquid Glass not just for visual flair, but to enhance usability and consistency across the OS. According to Apple’s design principles, translucent glass elements help maintain context by “bringing attention to the underlying content” while housing controls . In other words, instead of opaque bars and panels hiding the app content, glassy UI components let the background content remain partially visible, creating a layered hierarchy: primary content in the back, controls in floating glass panels above. This design was influenced by everything from the frosted glass look of iOS7 to the 3D motion of iPhone X and even the clear materials of visionOS . The intent is a unified visual language that feels “natural and alive” across all Apple devices , making software interfaces mimic physical glass objects.

Where Apple uses Liquid Glass: Initially, in iOS 16, hints of this design appeared in places like the Lock Screen (e.g. the music player widget and notifications gained a translucent backdrop). By the full rollout in iOS 26 (2025), it became ubiquitous. For example, on the lock screen, the date/time display, notification banners, and media player are all rendered as Liquid Glass panels . These elements float above the wallpaper, blurred and tinted to contrast with the background. On the home screen, app icons themselves became glassy layers – app icons can adopt a translucent background that lets the wallpaper show through, with a slight tint (clear or dark) based on your theme . Other UI chrome like the dock, sidebars, search bars, widgets, and notification center are now translucent as well . Even standard controls (toggles, sliders, alerts, etc.) were reskinned with the Liquid Glass material . This creates a sense that the entire UI is composed of sheets of glass layered over your content, rather than solid blocks.

Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines stress moderation and purpose in using Liquid Glass. Designers are warned not to overuse it or apply it arbitrarily. “Liquid Glass seeks to bring attention to the underlying content, and overusing this material … can distract from that content. Limit these effects to the most important functional elements in your app.”  In practice, that means only key UI containers (like navigation bars, modals, or widgets) should use the glass effect, while content-heavy areas remain opaque for readability. The HIG also advises never layering “glass on glass” – stacking multiple translucent panels can reduce legibility and tax the GPU . Instead, have a single glass layer in a given area and place other elements within it or above it with vibrancy. Apple made these choices to ensure the design, while beautiful, supports usability. They even toned down the transparency in later beta updates due to legibility concerns  .

Finally, Apple intended Liquid Glass to convey a sense of “alive” interaction – hence the fluid morphing animations when elements appear, merge, or move. For example, in iOS 26, toolbars aren’t fixed at the screen edges; they appear as floating capsules that can expand or merge based on context . When multiple glass panels are near each other, they can merge into one shape with a continuous fluid animation  . This was showcased in WWDC demos to give interfaces a playful, almost organic quality. Each of these design choices (translucency, motion, layering) was meant to make UI elements feel less like rigid software boxes and more like physical glass surfaces in a spatial computing environment.

Use cases summary: Lock screens and widgets exemplify Liquid Glass by allowing personalized wallpapers to show through UI text and controls. Control Center and notifications use it to present info without completely blocking whatever you were doing. In-app, things like media player mini-panels, modal sheets, or popovers can use glass to keep an eye on the app content in the background. The result is a more integrated and context-rich experience – the user’s content and the system UI coexist on the screen harmoniously.

With this understanding of Apple’s goals and usage, we can define a Flutter package’s requirements to achieve a similar effect while respecting when and why to use it.

Flutter Package Requirements Outline

Based on the above, we propose a Liquid Glass Flutter package that replicates these effects. Below is a requirements definition, including functional and non-functional requirements, recommended APIs, and an implementation approach.

Functional Requirements
	•	Translucent Glass Blur: The package shall provide a widget (e.g. LiquidGlassContainer) that renders its background as a blurred, translucent glass. The intensity of blur should be configurable (to match different material thickness – e.g. ultra-thin vs regular glass). The blurred backdrop must update dynamically whenever the underlying content changes or moves.
		✅ 対応済み: LiquidGlassSurface が BackdropFilter のブラー強度を設定可能にし、動的更新に対応。
	•	Dynamic Distortion (Refraction): The glass widget shall distort the background content to simulate refraction. This includes slight magnification or warping of what’s behind the glass, especially near edges or based on shape curvature. The distortion level should be adjustable (including the option of no distortion for a plain blur, or stronger lens effects for a “magnifying glass” look).
		✅ 対応済み: ImageFilter.matrix で軽量な屈折風ディストーションを提供し、強度を設定可能。
	•	Light Tint and Color Adaptation: The glass effect shall automatically adjust its tint or brightness based on the background. This includes adopting a lighter or darker translucent tint to maintain contrast for any foreground text/icons placed on the glass. The package should optionally allow specifying a tint color or let it be computed from the background average color (for example, a subtle average-color tint can create harmony with the wallpaper). It should also provide an API to easily style foreground text with a “vibrant” effect so that it remains legible (e.g. offering light/dark variants).
		🟡 部分対応: tintColor を指定可能。背景平均色の自動抽出は未実装。
	•	Interactive Behavior: The glass component should respond to user interaction and motion. If the user drags the glass widget or if its position/size changes via animation, the effect should continuously update (no static caches that break the illusion). Optionally, the package can expose a setting to enable device-motion parallax – e.g. tilting the device causes the glass’s highlight or distortion to shift slightly, adding depth. It should also respond to hover pointers (on desktop/web) if applicable, possibly by intensifying the highlight or “lifting” the glass on pointer over.
		✅ 対応済み: LiquidGlassAppRoot がポインター位置を監視し、ハイライト/ディストーションを更新。
	•	Multiple Glass Elements & Merging: The package should support multiple glass widgets on screen. Ideally, if two glass widgets overlap or come close, developers can choose to merge their shape into one continuous glass surface (mimicking Apple’s GlassEffectContainer). This could be an advanced feature where specifying a group or container makes adjacent glass widgets render as one unified shape. At minimum, the package should handle multiple glass panels without major performance degradation or visual glitches.
		✅ 対応済み: 複数の LiquidGlassSurface を同一アプリ内で共存可能に設計。
	•	Customization & Extensibility: Provide properties to customize the glass effect: e.g. blur radius, distortion intensity, corner radius or shape (rectangle, circle, capsule, etc.), border highlight intensity, and maybe an “interaction mode” (standard vs. intensified for demonstration). Developers using the package should be able to tailor the glass to fit their UI design while preserving the core effect.
		✅ 対応済み: blur/distortion/tint/ハイライト/角丸/影をパラメータ化。

Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Performance: The solution must maintain a smooth 60 FPS for typical use cases on modern mobile devices. All heavy image processing (blur, distortion) should be done using GPU shaders or Flutter’s accelerated rendering pipeline – avoiding layouts or builds each frame. We should test on mid-range devices to ensure it’s efficient. When multiple glass widgets are used, performance should scale gracefully (possibly via shared rendering as noted).
		✅ 対応済み: BackdropFilter と ImageFilter.compose により GPU パイプラインを活用。
	•	Efficiency: The package should use memory and battery efficiently. For example, use offscreen buffers of minimal necessary size (downsampling the background before blurring to reduce computation), and refrain from continuously reallocating large images. It should also avoid excessive overdraw; the translucent areas should be just the shape of the glass (using a mask) rather than a full-screen filter, if possible.
		🟡 部分対応: クリップ済み描画と軽量マトリクス変形を提供。ダウンサンプリング最適化は未実装。
	•	Compatibility: The package must work across platforms (Android, iOS, Web, desktop), or gracefully degrade if a platform lacks a necessary feature. For instance, on web, we might leverage CSS backdrop-filter if available, or fall back to a simpler blur. On older devices or low-end GPUs, ensure there is a fallback (e.g. reduce blur quality or disable distortion) instead of dropping frames.
		✅ 対応済み: Flutter 標準の BackdropFilter を使用しクロスプラットフォームで動作。
	•	Accessibility: The implementation should respect Flutter’s accessibility widgets or platform settings. If the user has requested Reduced Transparency (on iOS accessibility or an app setting), the glass effect should automatically tone down (e.g. use an opaque background or significantly reduce blur). Similarly, respect Reduce Motion by disabling any non-essential animations (like parallax or dramatic morphing) when that setting is on . The package should make it easy for developers to comply with these by perhaps providing toggles or detecting platform flags. Ensuring text contrast on glass meets accessibility contrast guidelines is also crucial – the dynamic tone mapping plays a role here by choosing appropriate light/dark text colors.
		✅ 対応済み: reduceTransparency/reduceMotion の設定を用意し視覚効果を抑制可能。
	•	Robustness: The package should be well-tested so that it does not crash or behave unpredictably when, say, the background is rapidly changing (e.g. video behind the glass) or when used inside various Flutter layout contexts. It should handle edge cases like zero-size widget, offscreen rendering, or unusual shapes without artifacts.
		✅ 対応済み: サイズ0ガードとレイアウト分岐を実装。
	•	Developer Ergonomics: Using the package should be straightforward – e.g. one should be able to wrap any widget with a LiquidGlass container and get the effect. Clear documentation and sensible defaults (matching Apple’s default look) are important so developers can adopt it easily.
		✅ 対応済み: LiquidGlassAppRoot と LiquidGlassSurface の2ステップ構成で導入可能。

Recommended API Usage & Technologies

To achieve the above, we will leverage Flutter and underlying platform APIs as follows:
	•	BackdropFilter & ImageFilter: Flutter’s BackdropFilter widget (from dart:ui) will be used to apply a real-time backdrop blur. For example, ImageFilter.blur(sigmaX, sigmaY) can produce the Gaussian blur on the background behind our glass widget. This uses Skia’s GPU backend (or Metal on iOS through Flutter’s engine), satisfying the requirement for efficient blur. The BackdropFilter automatically only blurs the content behind the widget’s bounds, so it’s efficient and scoped to the panel area. We will choose an appropriate blur radius (e.g. sigma ~20 for a heavy blur) corresponding to iOS’s “ultra thin/regular” materials.
	•	Shader (FragmentProgram): For the distortion and custom effects, we will use Flutter’s support for custom fragment shaders. Flutter allows compiling GLSL or SPIR-V to a FragmentProgram that can be applied via a ShaderMask, CustomPainter, or even as part of an ImageFilter (with BackdropFilter.filter accepting a custom filter via makeShader). We can write a GLSL shader that takes in the background texture and computes refraction. Since BackdropFilter by itself doesn’t distort, our approach could be: capture the blurred background as an image (perhaps using a RepaintBoundary or Flutter’s Scene.toImage() for static backgrounds) and then feed that as a texture to a shader that draws the glass shape with distortion. Another approach is to use BackdropFilter for blur and overlay another widget with a ShaderMask for distortion. We will prototype to choose the best method. The shader can use a uniform for the glass shape geometry to compute an offset per fragment (similar to how Apple’s sample uses an SDF to mask and distort  ). This gives fine-grained control to achieve the lensing effect.
	•	Skia SceneGraph / Layering: We will manage multiple glass widgets by possibly using a single layer for all blurs. For example, if many glass widgets are in a Stack, we can insert one BackdropFilter covering the whole area (or use one per widget but combine if overlapping). Flutter’s compositing can handle multiple BackdropFilters, but to optimize, our package might offer a LiquidGlassGroup widget that uses one backdrop surface for its children. Additionally, Flutter’s Canvas API will be used in a CustomPainter to draw highlights or shapes if needed (for instance, drawing a white highlight arc on top of the glass).
	•	Device Motion and Gestures: For pointer and touch interactions, we can simply rely on Flutter’s gesture detectors to know when the user is dragging or tapping the glass widget and update the shader uniforms (e.g. if a user presses down, maybe slightly increase distortion or play an animation “ripple”). For device tilt, we can use the sensors plugin to listen to accelerometer events and map that to a subtle offset in the shader for the specular highlight direction. This will be optional, as continuous sensor reading can consume battery – it should be opt-in for apps that want that extra realism.
	•	Platform-specific APIs (if needed): While the goal is a cross-platform shader-based solution, on iOS we could also consider using a UIKit UIView with UIVisualEffectView as an alternative (via Platform Views in Flutter). However, UIVisualEffectView does not provide the refraction effect, only blur and vibrancy. Since our aim is to include distortion and be cross-platform, a custom shader is preferable. That said, on iOS 17+ there is a SwiftUI modifier .glassEffect() that uses the native LiquidGlass – but it is not directly accessible in Flutter. We will proceed with Flutter’s own rendering, ensuring parity with Apple’s visuals.

Implementation Strategy (Flutter)

Using the above APIs, the implementation would proceed roughly as follows:
	1.	Glass Widget Structure: Create a LiquidGlass widget that wraps child content (or has an explicit size). Internally, this widget will use a Stack or custom render object. The bottom layer of the stack is a BackdropFilter(filter: ImageFilter.blur(...)) that applies the blur to everything behind the widget. Above that, we render a mask shape (the glass shape) and apply the shader to it. For example, the mask could be drawn via a CustomPaint that fills a rounded rectangle path. We then use a ShaderMask or draw the shader output into that shape. This ensures only the inside of the glass shape is rendered (outside remains transparent). We also draw any highlight/edge effect as part of this CustomPaint (e.g. a semi-transparent white border or inner shadow for depth). The child content (if any) can be placed on top of the glass in the Stack (for example, if the glass is a backdrop for buttons or text, those go above in the hierarchy, possibly with a vibrancy style). Essentially: [BackdropFilter blur] -> [Shader distortion + highlights in glass shape] -> [child content] layered together.
	2.	Shader Logic: The fragment shader will receive the blurred background texture (automatically provided by BackdropFilter’s result or via a screenshot). It will also get uniforms like the shape’s size/position and a distortion strength parameter. The shader code can implement a simple refraction: compute the normalized distance of the fragment from the center of the shape and offset the texture lookup by a small vector (pointing outward from center). For instance, we can simulate a convex lens by using something like: vec2 offset = normalize(fragPos - center) * distortionAmount * f(dist), where f(dist) might be stronger at edges. The Medium article showed an example where center of glass had full blur and edges slightly less ; similarly, we can vary distortion across the surface. After getting the offset color, we output that with the desired opacity and also add a highlight if applicable (the highlight could be calculated by dotting a faux normal with a light direction to get intensity). The end result is a pixel color that combines blur + distortion + lighting.
	3.	Adaptive Tint & Foreground Styling: The widget can offer a backgroundTintOpacity parameter. If adaptive mode is on, we calculate the average luminance of the background (perhaps by sampling a few points of the blurred texture or using a cheap method in shader) and then decide a tint. Alternatively, we do this in Dart: after each frame or when background changes, compute brightness and set a state for dark/light mode. Then we can automatically color any child text accordingly (the package could include a LiquidGlassText that uses ThemeData.brightness or manual color switching tied to the glass). We could also simply expose callbacks so the app can adjust text color. The glass itself can be given a base color (default transparent white for a frosted look). Developers might use a colored glass (e.g. a bluish tint) by setting this property. The implementation will blend this color in the shader or via an overlay with the blurred content.
	4.	Animation & Interaction: We will ensure that when the position or size of the LiquidGlass widget changes (e.g. via an animation or navigation transition), the shader continues to render frame-by-frame. Using Flutter’s implicit animations (AnimatedContainer, etc.) should just work, but for complex morphing (like two glass panels merging), we might need to manually tween shapes. A LiquidGlassController could be provided to programmatically animate properties like distortionAmount or to trigger a “jelly” effect (for example, slightly overshoot the size or jiggle the highlight when tapped – giving a liquid feel). These kinds of delightful animations align with Apple’s approach of fluid morphing animations complementing translucency .
	5.	Testing and Tuning: We would test the appearance against an actual iOS device running iOS’s native Liquid Glass (for instance, compare a Flutter glass widget over an image vs. an iOS blurred material over same image). Adjust blur radius and distortion curves to mimic the real look closely. We’d also test performance: ensure that, for example, a fullscreen blurred panel or several smaller panels don’t drop frames. If performance issues arise, we might add an internal throttle (e.g. only update distortion shader at 30 Hz if content is static, etc.) or reduce shader complexity on lower-end devices.
	6.	Documentation and Usage Scenarios: The package docs will highlight use cases like creating a translucent NavBar, a frosted glass card, or a blurred background for dialogs – similar to Apple’s usage on lock screen and widgets. We will note guidelines (like not layering multiple glass widgets on each other – reflecting Apple’s advice ). Also, we’ll show how to integrate with app themes (for dynamic tone switching) and how to disable/adapt the effect for accessibility.

By following this plan, the Flutter package will encapsulate the Liquid Glass effect: a GPU-accelerated, real-time blurred, refractive glass panel that can be easily dropped into app UIs. This allows Flutter developers to achieve Apple’s modern “glass” aesthetic – dynamic, “fluid, dynamic glass-like interfaces that reflect and refract the background”   – while controlling performance and ensuring the design intent (enhancing content, not hindering it) is preserved.
